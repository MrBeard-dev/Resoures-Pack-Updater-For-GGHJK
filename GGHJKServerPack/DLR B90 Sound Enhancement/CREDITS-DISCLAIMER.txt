The mini version of the B90 is an edited version of the LHI T851 made by ナビィ (aka Navi), AdoraLi and Mei Fwong,
with some changes made such as skirts, couplers and transverse seats. I, c()inc do not own the model, even it's modifications.

Thanks to Navi/ナビィ for the sounds and some parts of the texture.
Finally, thanks to SirPiglin for the texture and the idea of remaking a DLR train !

Credits to Curt for converting the 1995 stock BVE sound into B90 sounds.
